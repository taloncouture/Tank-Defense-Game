# Tank-Defense-Game
A simple game made with Python using the Pygame module.

The way to run this would be to download the zio file, and then navigate to the folder via terminal/command line
and run it with the command: python3 game.py (may be a little different on other systems).

Controls: spacebar: to shoot/enter the game and arrow keys: movement
